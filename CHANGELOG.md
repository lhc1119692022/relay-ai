# Changelog

## [0.11.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **Manually add models missing from a provider's catalog.** The Providers page and `relay-ai providers` wizard offer **Add model manually** for API-key OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenRouter providers. Enter an exact model ID, optional display name and optional context size. **Test & Add** uses the provider's existing credentials for three small streamed requests: generation, a harmless tool call with automatic tool selection, and a tool-result continuation. Failed or incomplete responses are not saved. Manual entries are stored separately, survive model-list refreshes, and appear in launch catalogs, favorites, the gateway, and embedded Core. Both interfaces support removing a manual entry. Unknown pricing, vision support, and unspecified context sizes are not claimed as verified capabilities.

### Fixed

- **GPT Astra with OpenAI OAuth:** update Relay's Codex Responses-Lite version header from `0.144.1` to `0.153.4`, which passed a live Astra request after the old header was rejected. The Claude adapter now preserves the original upstream status and message when collecting a streamed response instead of replacing it with `502 No output generated`. Thanks to the Issue #68 reporter for the testing tips that helped identify the fix. ([Issue #68](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/68))
- **Codex App WebSocket framing:** correctly handles control frames, multiple frames received in one network chunk, and fragmented request messages. This prevents valid Windows ChatGPT/Codex requests from being dropped or parsed as invalid JSON, avoiding the reconnect loop reported in [Issue #72](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/72).
- **Codex App image input:** preserve Responses API `input_image` parts when translating requests to external providers, so image prompts are no longer silently reduced to text-only prompts.
- **Codex provider failures:** emit a proper Responses `response.failed` event for upstream errors, so capability failures such as “No endpoints found that support image input” are shown to the user instead of appearing as a blank response or successful empty turn.
- **Windows ChatGPT cleanup:** when ChatGPT remains alive as a tray/background process after Ctrl+C, Relay now escalates from graceful shutdown to a guarded force-quit before restoring `config.toml`. Help and `--restore` paths also skip the background models.dev refresh, preventing a Windows Node/libuv shutdown assertion.
- **Blank manual-model context:** optional context input is now omitted when blank or undefined, instead of being converted to `NaN` and rejected by the model registry.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- **Vercel AI SDK v7.** Relay now uses `ai` ^7 and matching `@ai-sdk/*` majors so embedded Core models emit `specificationVersion: 'v4'` and share one SDK generation with consumers already on v7 (for example Alef). Node.js 22+ is required. SDK call params use `instructions` instead of `system`, streaming uses `result.stream`, and image parts are `file`. Anthropic and Codex wire formats are unchanged. Venice is routed through `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` instead of the v6-era `venice-ai-sdk-provider` package. `@ai-sdk/vercel` remains bundled but is deprecated upstream (its v0 API is gone); Relay has no Vercel template. ([Issue #71](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/71))

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- **Antigravity's compact label is now `Antigravity`.** `providerShortName` returned `Cloud Code Assist`, which is both longer than necessary and not the name any surface actually uses for this provider — an embedded Core consumer showing compact labels still ended up with a long, unfamiliar string. The provider's full `name` is unchanged, so nothing that displays the long form is affected.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **OpenCode Go conversation sessions.** Relay now forwards a stable conversation identifier as `x-opencode-session` on every OpenCode Go request, resolved from the client's own native session/thread/conversation headers or request metadata, and carries a truthful `relay-ai/<version>` user agent. When a per-request call has no client identifier (for example a client's pre-conversation availability probe), Relay fabricates a fresh unique per-request id so Console Go accepts it; a per-request id is unique and never blends two conversations the way a shared per-process id would. Embedded Core opts out of fabrication (its model can be reused across conversations) and adds an optional `sessionId` to `createRelayModel(...)`. Wired through the Claude Code proxy, transparent proxy, `relay-ai server`, Codex Responses, Gemini, and Antigravity transports. See [docs/OPENCODE-GO-SESSIONS.md](docs/OPENCODE-GO-SESSIONS.md). ([Issue #69](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/69), [Issue #70](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/70))

### Fixed

- **Antigravity multi-model switching now works on newer `agy` versions.** Relay gated switching behind a hand-maintained list of tested `agy` versions, so any release past the last-listed one silently dropped to single-model mode — only the launch model in `/model`, favorites not exposed — even when Antigravity's internal slot config was unchanged. Relay now trusts its slot-config shape validation as the real gate: an unlisted version whose shape still matches keeps multi-model switching, while genuinely changed layouts and known-incompatible versions still fall back safely.
- **Antigravity now sends the OpenCode Go session header it computes.** The Cloud Code gateway built its `streamText`/`generateText` calls by listing fields explicitly and omitted the request headers, so `x-opencode-session` and the Relay user agent were computed and then dropped on the `relay-ai agy` transport.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Compact provider labels for embedded Core consumers.** `listRelayModels()` now includes `providerShortName` for space-constrained model lists, with a fallback to `providerName`. Built-in long provider names expose concise labels without changing their existing display names. ([Issue #67](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/67))

## [0.9.7] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- **`relay-ai codex-app` now closes ChatGPT Desktop before restoring Relay's temporary Codex configuration.** Relay waits for Desktop to exit before restoring the config and stopping its proxy; if Desktop does not exit, it reports recovery instructions instead of claiming cleanup completed. ([Issue #65](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/65))

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **macOS ChatGPT Desktop restarts now identify the main process reliably.** Relay uses a full `ps` process snapshot and the exact installed executable path, while excluding helper processes, unrelated applications, and Relay's own PID. Thanks to [@Derivedbetter](https://github.com/Derivedbetter) in [PR #64](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/64) for the fix and live reproduction.
- **Codex Desktop launches are safer across startup, identity, and shutdown.** Relay waits for the app to become ready, preserves the correct external runtime identity, and keeps unattended shutdown and macOS lifecycle handling fail-closed. Thanks to [@Derivedbetter](https://github.com/Derivedbetter) in [PR #53](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/53).
- **External Codex Responses WebSocket sessions now remain persistent across turns.** Relay keeps the connection alive for follow-up requests and preserves the expected close behavior for overlapping requests. Thanks to [@jacob-bd](https://github.com/jacob-bd) in [PR #58](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/58), addressing [Issue #55](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/55).
- **Codex WebSocket tool continuations now preserve response context.** External `previous_response_id` state is retained per connection with bounded history and orphaned continuations are rejected before reaching the provider; native persistent connections reset per-turn completion state correctly. Thanks to [@jacob-bd](https://github.com/jacob-bd) in [PR #62](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/62), addressing [Issues #57](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/57) and [#59](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/59).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **`relay-ai codex --with-native` now works on Windows.** Mixed mode located the npm-installed `codex.cmd` shim and then invoked it through Node's raw `execFileSync`/`execFile`, which cannot execute a `.cmd` and failed with `spawnSync codex.cmd EINVAL` before Relay could capture the native model catalog. Codex CLI discovery, the mixed-mode probe, native-catalog capture, and launch all route through `cross-spawn` — already a Relay dependency, already used by the Claude and Antigravity launchers for exactly this — so argv is preserved without a `shell: true` path and hand-written `cmd.exe` escaping. *Verified on a real Windows 10.0.26200 install; the `.cmd` shim integration tests cover spaces, quotes, percent variables, metacharacters, empty strings, Unicode, and trailing backslashes, and they only execute on Windows.*
- **The ChatGPT desktop app installed from the Microsoft Store is now discovered.** `findEmbeddedCodexBinary()` was gated to macOS and Linux, so a Store install reported the embedded Codex runtime as missing and mixed Desktop mode was unavailable. Relay now resolves the package install location through `Get-AppxPackage`, and because Windows refuses to execute a child process directly out of `WindowsApps`, copies the version-stamped binary into `~/.relay-ai/codex/embedded-runtime/{package}/codex.exe` before running it. Unpackaged Windows installs and the macOS/Linux paths are unchanged. *Verified live against `OpenAI.Codex_26.810.7004.0_x64`: direct execution from `WindowsApps` fails, and the cached copy runs as `codex-cli 0.148.0-alpha.9`.*
- **Tool parameters named after JSON Schema keywords are no longer deleted for Antigravity/Cloud Code models.** The Anthropic-to-Cloud-Code translator walked the whole schema stripping draft-meta keys, and could not distinguish a *keyword* named `type`, `items`, `title`, `format`, or `pattern` from a *tool's own property* with that name, so any such parameter was silently dropped and the tool then misbehaved. Property maps are now recursed as values rather than treated as keyword space. Schema type enums, nullable unions, enum values, tuple `items`, and local `$ref`s are normalized into the Cloud Code Schema dialect, and the nonstandard Codex `encrypted` annotation is stripped recursively.
- **`thinkingBudget: 0` is no longer sent to Cloud Code models.** Current Gemini models reject it outright. Cloud Code thought text was already suppressed on the response path, so removing the flag does not surface reasoning to the client.
- **Deprecated Antigravity model ids now resolve to the model Google actually serves.** Google's live catalog marks `gemini-3.1-pro-high` deprecated with `newModelId: gemini-pro-agent`; Relay discarded that redirect, so the friendly Pro High entry returned HTTP 400 while `gemini-pro-agent` worked. The picker/catalog id stays stable while requests route through the canonical upstream id. Redirect chains are followed defensively and stop on a cycle.
- **Two providers offering the same model name no longer collide in Codex routing.** `findCodexProxyRoute` ignored the provider half of a `provider__model` catalog id and matched on the bare model name, so a duplicate name routed to whichever provider appeared first. The provider prefix is now honored before the existing unqualified lookup, including when wrapped in a Codex app catalog slug.
- **Switching from a Relay model to a native OpenAI model mid-session no longer discards the conversation.** Relay-backed models must synthesize remote-compaction items because they cannot mint OpenAI-authenticated `encrypted_content`; OpenAI cannot verify that item and rejected the request with HTTP 400 `invalid_encrypted_content`. Relay's own version-marked compaction item is converted to readable message history before the request crosses the native boundary, over both HTTP forwarding and initial/subsequent Responses-Lite WebSocket frames. Genuine OpenAI encrypted compaction items are forwarded byte-for-byte, and the compaction decoder now requires its own version marker so a foreign payload is never mistaken for Relay's.
- **External models in the Codex desktop picker are no longer told they are Codex.** Relay builds external catalog entries from a native Codex instruction template that opens `You are Codex, an agent based on GPT-5...`, so Gemini and Claude received a contradictory identity along with a `comp_hash` that no longer described the instructions being sent. The identity claims are removed and the stale hash is dropped; generic Codex workspace and tool guidance is kept, and native entries are untouched. Stripping preserves markdown structure: a sentence-initial `As Codex,` is handled before the general rule, which otherwise consumed the blank line after a heading and produced `# Personality, you are an excellent communicator...` in the instructions sent to every external model.
- **An unattended `codex-app` session can now be stopped.** `--yes` suppressed the launch and restart confirmations but not the two shutdown prompts, so `SIGINT` asked *"Close ChatGPT Desktop and restore your Codex config?"* with no terminal to answer it: a supervisor could start a session but not reliably stop one, and on Windows `SIGINT` is the only realistic stop signal. Under `--yes`, `SIGINT` now behaves like `SIGTERM` and the app closes without asking. Interactive sessions still prompt.

### Added

- **`relay-ai codex-app --yes` / `-y` for unattended launches.** Scheduled and background launches previously stalled on interactive confirmations, so the process looked started but never patched the Codex config or opened the app. To keep an unattended launch from relying on saved or default choices, `--yes` requires `--provider`, `--model`, and either `--with-native` or `--relay-only`, and refuses to run if any is missing. It is rejected together with `--vertex`, whose flow remains interactive.

### Thanks

- Ronald Hickman ([@Derivedbetter](https://github.com/Derivedbetter)) contributed the Windows Codex fixes, the Cloud Code schema translation work, the Antigravity model-alias fix, the Codex routing and compaction fixes, and the unattended launch flag across [#44](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/44), [#45](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/45), [#46](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/46), [#47](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/47), [#48](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/48), [#49](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/49), [#50](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/50), and [#51](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/51).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Claude Code model switches now recalculate context windows.** Gateway sessions no longer pin `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` to the launch model or inherit a stale parent-shell value, so live switches between native Claude and Relay 1M models can use the correct window instead of triggering premature compaction or a compaction loop. Relay's `[1m]` model identity remains intact.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Custom endpoint headers are no longer dropped when a model list is refreshed.** `addCustomEndpointProvider` passed `api.headers` when it first fetched models, but `refreshApiListProvider` called `fetchAnthropicModels` and `fetchTemplateModels` without them. A backend whose account is identified by a static header (a plan or tenant header) therefore worked when added and broke the first time its models were refreshed.
- **Two custom Anthropic backends on one gateway no longer cross-wire credentials.** `aliasModelId()` returned any id beginning `claude-` unchanged, so two custom backends against the same upstream produced *identical* route ids: `buildCatalogRoutes` dropped the second as a duplicate and the proxy's alias map collided, silently sending one account's requests through the other's API key. Custom providers (`custom-*`) now get their `claude-*` ids scoped to `anthropic-{providerId}__{modelId}` like every other provider. Built-in `anthropic` and `claude-code` are unchanged, so no existing favorite, `~/.claude/settings.json` value, or gateway discovery cache is invalidated on upgrade.
- **A custom backend served over local HTTP can be refreshed.** Permission to use `http://` was granted interactively at add time and never persisted, and refresh re-validated with `allowInsecureLocal` derived from a provider template — which a custom backend does not have. Every local custom backend failed with "Only HTTPS URLs are allowed" on refresh. Custom backends now receive the same grant on refresh that they received on add; this does not widen the guard, which still rejects `http://` unless every resolved address is loopback or private.

- **Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`) tool calls no longer arrive with empty arguments.** Responses-Lite frames can omit required fields on *every* frame of a function call — `output_item.added` and `output_item.done` without `id`/`arguments`/`status`, and argument deltas without `item_id`/`output_index`. Relay minted a fresh item id per frame, discarded the accumulated argument deltas, emitted a completed tool call with `arguments: ""`, and then suppressed recovery from `response.completed.output` because that call id was already marked done. The WebSocket adapter now keeps durable per-call state (item id, call id, name, accumulated deltas, completion state), reuses one item id across `added`/`delta`/`done`, completes from the accumulated deltas when `done` omits them, and defers to the authoritative `response.completed` output rather than fabricating an empty call.
- **Concurrent Luna function calls no longer cross-contaminate.** A call is identified by `call_id` first, then item id, then — only for the call *currently open* at that index — `output_index`. Providers that reuse or restart `output_index` across sequential calls, and argument deltas that carry no identity at all, now land on the right call instead of the oldest one at that index.
- **A function call that never receives arguments is reported, not invented.** When neither argument deltas nor `response.completed.output` ever supply an argument string, Relay emits an `incomplete_function_call` error instead of completing the call with `arguments: ""` — which is not valid JSON and is the exact failure this normalization exists to prevent. This holds on the recovery path too: `response.completed.output` is authoritative for a call's identity but may still omit its arguments.
- **Concurrent requests on one Cloud Code Assist model both recover from an expired token.** Two in-flight requests that sent the same expired token and both received 401 shared one deduplicated refresh; the first retried and updated the shared token, then the second compared the refreshed token against that already-updated shared value, skipped its own retry, and returned its original 401. Each request now tracks the token it actually sent, so every 401'd request gets exactly one retry with the refreshed credential.
- **Cloud Code Assist inference now uses the documented ordered endpoint fallback.** `streamGenerateContent` and `generateContent` were frozen to the first base URL, so authentication could succeed through a fallback endpoint while every inference request failed against the first. Both paths now walk the endpoint list in order on network failures and endpoint-specific statuses (404, 408, 429, 5xx), decide before reading any response body so a streaming response is never abandoned mid-flight, never replay a client-error request across every endpoint, stop immediately on abort, and keep the one-refresh/one-retry limit for 401. A credential refresh resumes the fallback *at* the endpoint that returned 401 rather than ending it, so a refreshed request whose endpoint is down still reaches the remaining endpoints — without replaying the ones that already failed for their own reasons.
- **`onDebug` now works on Cloud Code Assist routes.** The specialized transport returned before forwarding the hook, so a documented Core diagnostics option silently did nothing there. Its messages report endpoint host, attempt number, status, byte counts, and error *names* only — never credentials, prompts, tool arguments, or response bodies.
- **OpenAI reasoning levels are now per-model and sourced from OpenAI's documentation** (verified 2026-08-14) instead of inferred from model-name families. Each model id carries its own documented level set *and* default: `gpt-5.2`/`5.4`/`5.5` offer `none…xhigh`; the `gpt-5.6` line adds `max`; the Pro variants (`gpt-5.2-pro`, `gpt-5.4-pro`, `gpt-5.5-pro`) offer only `medium`/`high`/`xhigh`, with `gpt-5.5-pro` defaulting to `high`; `gpt-5-pro` offers only `high`; and `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.2-codex` and `gpt-5.3-codex` are recognised instead of falling through. Levels are sent verbatim or omitted — never substituted.
- **A base model's capabilities no longer leak into its named descendants.** Matching is on the exact model id, with a dated snapshot suffix (`-2026-04-23`) as the only alias. Prefix matching had given every `gpt-5.x-*` id its base model's set, so the Pro variants advertised and sent `none`/`low` that OpenAI rejects, `gpt-5.2-codex` inherited an unsupported `none`, and `gpt-5.2-chat-latest` — a chat model with no reasoning at all — was reported as adjustable.
- **The capability table and the request mapper now share one "does this model reason" signal**, so the mapper can no longer build a `reasoning_effort` for a model the catalog reports as non-reasoning.
- **OpenAI reasoning now uses the same transport decision as model construction.** The capability check used a narrower "prefers Responses" rule than the factory's actual endpoint choice, so models like `gpt-5.2` were served over Responses yet reported as having no adjustable reasoning at all, and Core rejected every level for them.
- **The reasoning picker no longer offers levels a provider cannot express.** Advertised levels are filtered through the same mapper that builds the request, so a level that maps to nothing — or to bytes another level already sends — can never be shown. On a 387-route local registry this removed 25 dead choices across 13 routes: every `@ai-sdk/alibaba` reasoning model (whose GLM/DeepSeek/Kimi levels had no mapping at all) and xAI's `none`.
- **Cloud Code models report the reasoning capabilities Core actually honors.** `listRelayModels()` classified them by the provider's registry package (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`) while `createRelayModel()` builds them with `@ai-sdk/google`, so Gemini routes were reported as `fixed` with no levels even though Core accepted `low`/`medium`/`high`. Both paths now resolve the package the same way.
- **xAI reasoning levels are now transport-specific**, matching the installed adapter's documentation: chat models offer `low`/`high`, Responses models offer `low`/`medium`/`high`. Previously `medium` was offered everywhere and silently arrived as `low`, and `none` was offered although xAI has no such value.

### Added

- **Custom backends can be edited instead of deleted and re-added.** `relay-ai providers` shows **Edit backend settings** for a custom backend (replacing "Change API key" for those entries only), and the web UI gains an **Edit Backend Settings** form on custom provider cards. Display name, base URL, API key, and headers are all editable. The provider id never changes on rename, so favorites, saved launch defaults, and the stored credential all keep resolving. A name-only edit makes no network call. A blank API key keeps the stored key — the stored key is never sent to the browser. Supplying headers replaces the whole set and an empty set removes them all, so a header can actually be deleted. On a failed connection test the settings can still be saved, with the previous model list preserved and reported as stale; a *refusal* (unknown provider, non-custom provider, blocked URL, credential-store failure) never offers that choice, because it could never succeed.
- **Several custom backends may point at the same base URL.** This is the supported way to run two accounts on one gateway, distinguished by API key or by a static header. Each instance gets its own provider id, its own stored credential, and its own model list. Only an exact match on URL *and* key *and* headers is treated as an accidental duplicate — it is reported before any network call and can be confirmed through, in both the CLI and the browser. Differing key or headers proceeds with no prompt. *Verified against live HTTP endpoints and at the route-construction level, including that two same-model Anthropic backends both survive into the catalog with separate credentials; a launch of Claude Code against two real Anthropic-compatible gateways was not performed.*
- **Provider-neutral reasoning contract in the embedded Core API.** `createRelayModel(routeId, { reasoning })` takes a level from the route's own `capabilities.reasoningLevels` and translates it into that route's request options inside Relay — an OpenAI `reasoning.effort`, a Gemini `thinkingConfig`, an OpenRouter `reasoning` object, and so on. Embedding applications never write provider-specific `providerOptions`. The level is validated against the route's real capabilities **before** mapping, so a level the route cannot express fails with `UNSUPPORTED_REASONING_LEVEL` (naming the levels it does have) rather than being substituted with the nearest available value — the CLI picker's nearest-value behavior is deliberately not the embedded contract. A per-call `providerOptions` passed to `streamText`/`generateText` still wins.

### Docs

- **`docs/CORE.md` documents `CreateRelayModelOptions`**, the reasoning contract, and the real `onDebug` scope. It no longer claims every `createRelayModel()` result is exactly the generic `createLanguageModel()` product — Cloud Code Assist routes use a specialized native transport, and a reasoning level returns a wrapped model.
- **The 0.9.2 Luna claim is qualified.** That fix, and this one, are proven against realistic synthetic fixtures that reproduce the production symptom; the exact production frame bytes were never captured and no live Luna canary was run. Luna, Cloud Code Assist, and the other OAuth providers are separate transports — this work does not establish that "all OAuth is fixed."

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Embedded Core now supports OAuth Cloud Code Assist routes.** `createRelayModel()` returns a native Google LanguageModel that calls Cloud Code Assist with the stored OAuth token and project id, instead of launching a local proxy.
- **Core no longer sends cloud-code models to an empty OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` URL.** Those routes are discriminated by provider id, OAuth auth, and `modelFormat: 'cloud-code'` before the generic factory path.
- **Streaming, tools, OAuth refresh, and Gemini signature round-tripping are covered.** The Cloud Code transport unwraps Assist envelopes, retries a 401 once, forwards AbortSignal, and preserves thought signatures across tool loops.
- **OpenAI OAuth Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`) now streams text and tool calls through Core.** `createRelayModel('openai-oauth::gpt-5.6-luna')` consumed by AI SDK `streamText()` was completing with usage and OpenAI provider metadata but no assistant text or tool calls. Responses-Lite WebSocket frames that omit SDK-required fields (`item_id`, `output_index`, function-call `id`/`arguments`/`status`) were forwarded unchanged; `@ai-sdk/openai` classified them as `unknown_chunk` and kept only `response.completed` usage. The WebSocket adapter now fills those fields and recovers final `response.output` when no deltas were forwarded. This is a separate transport bug from Cloud Code Assist — other OAuth providers are unchanged. *(Qualified in 0.9.3: proven against realistic synthetic fixtures matching the production symptom, not against captured production frame bytes, and not confirmed by a live Luna canary. 0.9.3 fixes a further incomplete-frame case this change did not cover.)*
- **Core can take an optional sanitized `onDebug` hook.** Diagnostics report event types, field names, counts, and lengths only — never credentials, prompts, or response bodies.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **General OAuth catalog and UI visibility.**

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Codex mixed native/Relay launches** — Codex CLI and the ChatGPT desktop app can load the selected Relay model alongside Codex's native model catalog, while Relay keeps native and Relay requests on their correct routes.
- **Codex SubAgent catalog** — users can build a separate, initially empty catalog from the CLI or Relay UI. It has one slot, does not import or synchronize with General Favorites, and routes every Codex-marked sub-agent to the configured Relay model.
- **Linux ChatGPT/Codex desktop support** — `relay-ai codex-app` and `relay-ai chatgpt` now discover and launch the Linux ChatGPT desktop package, including its embedded Codex runtime. On X11/RDP, Relay resolves the display that owns the launching terminal so the app opens in the active graphical session.

### Fixed

- **Codex SubAgents worker boundary** — marked Codex child requests no longer receive collaboration-management tools, preventing recursive worker deployment while preserving repository tools.
- **Codex SubAgents payload routing** — HTTP and Responses-Lite WebSocket child requests now resolve and normalize collaboration payloads before the Relay model is contacted.
- **Plaintext Codex SubAgents results** — valid text-only collaboration envelopes are accepted without duplicating their payload or rejecting the worker result.
- **Deterministic Codex SubAgent selection** — every Codex-marked child uses the one configured Relay model; Relay no longer creates model-specific files in `$CODEX_HOME/agents` and removes only stale Relay-managed definitions.
- **Linux desktop restart behavior** — ChatGPT and Claude Desktop are restarted deterministically when Relay must apply a temporary configuration, including tray-hidden Electron processes.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **ClinePass provider support** — Relay now supports ClinePass through both API-key and WorkOS device-code OAuth authentication, including model catalog discovery, credential storage, token refresh, and the CLI/Admin UI setup flows.
- **ClinePass model routing** — ClinePass models are available across Relay launch surfaces with provider-scoped credentials and one-shot recovery when an OAuth access token expires.

### Fixed

- **ClinePass context display now reflects available metadata.** Models without a provider-reported context window no longer all appear as `131k ctx`; Relay leaves the value unknown until ClinePass supplies a model-specific limit.
- **ClinePass API-key setup now validates against the account endpoint.** Valid keys are no longer rejected because Relay probed the obsolete model-list endpoint before saving them.
- **Provider wizard failures are now visible and actionable.** Failed additions show the exact provider error, confirm that no changes were saved, and preserve a nonzero exit status when the wizard is finished after a failed operation.

### Docs

- **ClinePass setup documentation** now covers the unified CLI/API-key/OAuth flow, credential switching, subscription billing semantics, and troubleshooting.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Antigravity voice input can no longer terminate an active coding session.** Relay no longer advertises audio or transcription support to Antigravity while no explicit transcription provider has been configured. If Antigravity still sends a recording, Relay rejects it locally with a clear “voice transcription isn’t supported yet” response, keeps the session usable for the next typed message, avoids sending the recording to any configured model (and therefore avoids surprise provider charges), and redacts audio payloads from trace previews.
- **Claude Code and Claude Desktop subagents now inherit the Relay model that launched them.** Partner models such as Qwen, Grok, and Kimi no longer fall back to Claude Sonnet when they delegate work, preventing `400 Unknown model: claude-sonnet-...` failures from providers that do not expose Anthropic models.
- **Explicit subagent model choices now respect the models available in the current Relay session.** When a partner model requests a favorite model for a subagent, Relay routes that child to the requested favorite; otherwise, the child inherits its parent's exact provider and model. The routing is isolated per Claude session and supports concurrent and nested subagents without leaking selections between conversations.
- **Claude Code 2.1.220's restricted subagent model validation is handled transparently.** Relay bridges Claude's locally accepted model aliases to session-scoped Relay routes, removes its internal routing marker before upstream requests, and leaves native Anthropic passthrough and unrelated tools unchanged.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Codex App sessions can resume after switching from a Relay model to a native OpenAI model.** Relay-generated Responses API function-call items now always use the required `fc_` item-ID prefix while preserving the provider's original tool `call_id`. Previously, a resumed session could send a saved `call_...` value as an item ID and fail with `invalid_id_prefix`.
- **Windows Antigravity IDE launches now reach and respond to Relay's Ctrl+C shutdown prompt.** The detached IDE launcher resolves as soon as the GUI process spawns instead of blocking until it exits, allowing Relay to install its shutdown listener. On Windows, Relay also captures Ctrl+C directly from raw terminal input and restores the terminal state before asking whether to close the isolated Relay IDE. Verified against a live Windows installation.
- **Windows Antigravity CLI preserves multi-word arguments.** The `agy.exe` launcher now uses `cross-spawn` without `shell: true`, preventing `cmd.exe` from re-tokenizing model labels and prompts containing spaces.
- **Big Pickle and GLM tool loops retain required reasoning context in Antigravity.** These OpenAI-compatible reasoning models now use the same bounded reasoning replay already used for DeepSeek when Antigravity omits thought parts from the next tool-result request.
- **Antigravity trace logging works consistently on Windows and every launch surface.** `agy`, Antigravity, and Antigravity IDE traces now use stable files under `~/.relay-ai/logs/`; traces include the resolved route, privacy-safe request structure, and sanitized upstream error details without recording prompts, tool arguments, request headers, or credentials.

### Maintenance

- Release CI now rejects a tag, package version, lockfile, or changelog mismatch before installing dependencies or publishing. GitHub Release notes are extracted from the section matching the pushed tag rather than whichever changelog section appears first.
- Live provider probes are excluded from the deterministic default test suite and remain available through `npm run test:live`, preventing local credentials, revoked tokens, or provider outages from breaking maintenance releases.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Windows: `Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)` crash on exit.** Every relay-ai command on Windows printed an ugly libuv assertion failure during process teardown. The entry point called `process.exit()` immediately, force-tearing-down libuv handles (stdin listeners, native keyring module) that were still mid-cleanup. Replaced with a graceful shutdown: set `process.exitCode` and let the event loop drain naturally, with an unref'd safety timer as a fallback.
- **Windows: multi-word CLI arguments silently truncated when launching Claude Code.** `launchClaude` spawns `claude.cmd` with `{ shell: true }` (required for `.cmd` files), but Node's `spawn` does not escape arguments in shell mode. cmd.exe re-tokenizes on whitespace, so `relay-ai claude -p "What is 7 times 8?"` reached Claude Code as just `What`. Replaced `child_process.spawn` with `cross-spawn`, which handles `.cmd` resolution and argument escaping internally without `shell: true`. Verified on a live Windows install: multi-word prompts now arrive intact as a single argument.


## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **API Gateway Server Auto-Start ([#40](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/40))**: Support `RELAY_AI_SERVER_AUTOSTART=true` (or `server.autostart: true` in `~/.relay-ai/config.json`) to automatically launch the in-process API Gateway server (port 17645) on container/system boot without requiring manual user interaction in the Web UI. Added a toggle control in the Web UI Server tab.
- **Provider Model Catalog Filters & Favorites Action Button**: Added a minimum context window size filter (`≥ 128k`, `≥ 200k`, `≥ 500k`, `≥ 1M`) and a `Free models only` checkbox to the Provider Model Catalog browser (`#provider/{id}`). Added an interactive `+` action button for each model row in full UI mode to quickly add models to Global Favorites (max 20/20) or Antigravity Favorites (max 6/6) with real-time room capacity checks and duplicate protection (hidden in API Gateway Server mode).
- Diagnostic log line (`sdk: dropped user turn with unrecognized block types: [...]`, visible under `--trace` in `~/.relay-ai/logs/proxy-debug.log`) for the case where a translated user turn would otherwise silently vanish instead of reaching the provider.

### Fixed

- **Container boot reboot loops from stale `/data/ui.lock` ([#40](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/40))**: `checkExistingServer` now uses a 3-tier health check combining same-PID matching, process existence checking, and an HTTP health probe against `/api/config`. Stale lockfiles from container restarts or hard crashes are cleared automatically instead of causing infinite Docker PID 1 restart loops.
- **Qwen (`@ai-sdk/alibaba`) no longer derails mid-session with a hallucinated "empty message"/translation tangent.** Every occurrence traced back to the same trigger: a request ending on a tool result (i.e. every step of a normal agentic tool loop) — a documented qwen/DashScope function-calling quirk where the model hallucinates an empty user turn instead of summarizing the tool output. Relay now appends a minimal neutral continuation turn when a qwen request ends on a tool message, scoped narrowly to that provider and invisible to Claude Code.
- **Status-line context meter no longer flickers empty→full on every turn for SDK-routed (non-Anthropic) models.** Relay was seeding `message_start` with `input_tokens: 0` and only reporting the real count once the stream finished; it now seeds a same-request estimate upfront so the meter shows a stable number from the first token.
- Hardened `serializeToolResultContent` against a missing tool-result `content` field, which previously could ship a JS `undefined` (not a string) into the upstream SDK call instead of an empty string.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **Mixed Anthropic + Relay mode (`relay-ai claude --http-proxy`) now puts Relay favorites in Claude Code's normal `/model` picker.** Claude Code only reads its gateway models cache when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is not the real `api.anthropic.com` host. Relay now points the child at a local sentinel host (`api.anthropic.com.relay.invalid`), still MITM-intercepted and forwarded to real Anthropic, seeds `~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json` with the session routes, and merges those entries into live `GET /v1/models` responses. Host + `x-anthropic-billing-header` (`cch=00000;`) are restored on the way upstream so Anthropic still sees byte-identical traffic. Subscription/OAuth login is unchanged.

### Docs

- README, AI-agents guide, troubleshooting, and internal architecture notes updated for the sentinel-host / gateway-cache path (removed the old “type `/model relay:...` manually” guidance).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Cloudflare Workers AI** added as a native provider (`relay-ai providers add`) — hosts open-weight models (Llama, Gemma, GLM, Kimi, and others). Setup asks for a Cloudflare Account ID in addition to the API token (new `accountIdPrompt` template field), substituting it into the base URL (`.../accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1`). Standard models get a free daily allowance (10,000 Neurons/day) tracked separately from list price so real pricing can still be shown; see `docs/PROVIDERS.md` for setup and known rate-limit/context-window gotchas.
- **Minimum context window enforcement** — models below a target's usable context floor are now hidden from that target's picker/favorites instead of failing at launch with a cryptic error (e.g. Claude Code's `400 Bad Request`, or Antigravity's `config.MaxTokenLimit cannot exceed the planner model's context window limit`). Floors: 128K for Claude Code, Codex, Codex/Claude desktop apps, and Gemini CLI (their system prompt + tool definitions already consume ~25K+ before the first message); 136K for Antigravity, which enforces its own stricter internal check (`context window - max output tokens >= 128,000`). The `relay-ai server`/`ui` API gateway target has no floor — callers own their own prompt size. Models with unreported context windows are never hidden (bad/missing registry metadata isn't the same as a small model). Saved Antigravity favorites below the floor are now dropped from the `/model` switch catalog rather than crashing agy when switched to.
- **Context window shown in model pickers** — model selection now shows a compact `128k ctx` tag next to price/free status (e.g. `Free (10k/day) · 24k ctx`, `$1.25/$10 1M · 400k ctx`) across CLI pickers, so context size is visible before launch.

### Fixed

- **Antigravity now starts on mid-sized context windows (136K–193K)** that previously failed. Antigravity's cascade executor requires at least 128K of input headroom; Relay was previously letting a model's full output-token allowance eat into that headroom (up to 65K), pushing the real usable floor to ~193K. Output tokens are now capped to leave the required 128K of input room, and every checkpoint config in the served catalog (including hidden cascade/plan anchor models) is clamped to fit the smallest model in the launch, so agy's precondition holds regardless of which entry it reads.
- **Antigravity gateway no longer executes a plain JSON answer as a tool call.** A model replying with `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}` was previously misdetected as a tool call named "Alice"; the gateway now only treats buffered JSON-shaped text as a tool call when the name matches a tool actually offered in that request.
- **Antigravity gateway no longer drops buffered text on a mid-stream provider error.** Buffered JSON-shaped text is now flushed as a normal response before a stream error (rate limit, disconnect) is reported, instead of being silently discarded.
- A stale `isFree` flag can no longer override real, non-zero pricing once it's resolved — a model only displays as free from a verified zero-cost price, a documented free-tier provider (e.g. NVIDIA), or an explicit provider-granted free-access rule (e.g. Cloudflare's 10,000 free Neurons/day on standard models, which is tracked separately from list price so it survives later pricing lookups).
- Antigravity route catalog IDs are now sanitized to a safe slug (dots and other special characters replaced with `_`) to avoid malformed model identifiers sent to Antigravity's picker.

### Changed

- **Linux support for `relay-ai claude-app`** ([#39](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/39)) — the Claude Desktop 3P launcher now works on Linux in addition to macOS and Windows. The 3P inference config is written to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Claude-3p` (Electron's `userData` + `-3p`), and app discovery, launch, running-detection, and graceful/force quit are implemented with process-name-exact matching (`pgrep -x claude-desktop`) so they can never collide with the `relay-ai claude-app` process itself. The Electron main process (the one without a `--type=` flag) is signalled for a clean whole-app shutdown.
- **Linux launch support for `relay-ai antigravity` and `relay-ai antigravity-ide`** — binary discovery, launch, running-detection, and quit now work on Linux. Antigravity ships as a single VS Code-fork Electron binary (`/usr/share/antigravity/antigravity`) shared by both commands; they are kept isolated by distinct relay-managed `--user-data-dir` profile directories, and all process matching / kills are scoped to those profile dirs so the user's own Antigravity is never touched. (The local gateway and model injection already worked on Linux.)

### Changed

- Cross-platform quit paths in the Claude Desktop and Antigravity launchers are now explicit per-platform branches instead of a macOS/`else` split, removing a latent footgun where the Windows PowerShell quit path could run on Linux.

### Fixed

- **Antigravity app/IDE launch no longer corrupts the terminal on Ctrl+C.** The GUI launchers now spawn the app detached (its own process group) with `stdio: 'ignore'`, matching the Claude Desktop launcher. Previously the app inherited relay's process group, so a Ctrl+C meant to stop the gateway also killed Antigravity mid-render, and its `stdio: 'inherit'` shutdown logs interleaved with relay's "Close Antigravity?" prompt — leaving the TTY in a raw state (stray `^[[D` arrow-key echoes). Most visible on Linux, where Antigravity is far more verbose. The `agy` CLI launcher keeps `stdio: 'inherit'` as it needs the terminal.

### Added

- **Embedded `@jacobbd/relay-ai/core` package for in-process consumers** ([#38](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/38)) — a new side-effect-free subpath export lets a Node.js app use Relay AI as a library, without launching the CLI, UI, or server:
  - `listRelayModels()` returns a credential-free catalog of every enabled provider's cached models, with favorites, context windows, camelCase pricing, and reasoning capabilities (`none` / `fixed` / `adjustable`, with levels and defaults) derived from the existing `getReasoningCapabilities()` machinery.
  - `createRelayModel(routeId)` resolves the provider credential — transparently refreshing expiring OpenAI/xAI OAuth tokens through the existing refresh path — and returns a ready Vercel AI SDK `LanguageModel`. State is re-read on every call, so re-authentication or provider changes take effect without restarting the consumer.
  - Models are addressed by unconditionally-scoped **route ids** (`` `${providerId}::${modelId}` ``), safe to persist long-term even when multiple providers expose the same bare model id.
  - Errors are thrown as `RelayCoreError` with machine-readable codes (`INVALID_ROUTE_ID`, `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`, `PROVIDER_DISABLED`, `CREDENTIAL_UNAVAILABLE`, `OAUTH_REFRESH_FAILED`, `UNSUPPORTED_MODEL`, `UNSUPPORTED_REGISTRY_VERSION`, `PROVIDER_LOAD_FAILED`) and never contain credential material.
  - Ownership boundary: Relay keeps sole ownership of provider registration, credentials, the OS keyring, and OAuth login/refresh; the consumer never receives or stores credential material.

### Changed

- **`loadRegistry()` gains a `{ persist }` option** — in-memory legacy migrations still always run, but persisting them to `providers.json` can now be skipped by read-only callers (the embedded Core API uses this). Default behavior is unchanged.

### Docs

- **New guide: [`docs/CORE.md`](docs/CORE.md)** — a full reference for embedding `@jacobbd/relay-ai/core` in any Node app: prerequisites, quick start, the complete API and `RelayModelDescriptor` field reference, route-id grammar, the full `RelayCoreErrorCode` table with retryable defaults, runtime guarantees, and troubleshooting. Linked from the README's command table and Embedded usage section.


## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-23

Thank you [@onexoluxion](https://github.com/onexoluxion) for contributing PRs [#29](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/29), [#30](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/30), [#31](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/31), [#32](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/32), [#33](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/33), [#35](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/35), [#36](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/36), and [#37](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/37). Your Windows testing and detailed bug reports made this maintenance release possible.

### Changed

- **Claude Desktop launches now expose the selected model plus saved favorites** — `relay-ai claude-app` puts the selected model first, appends available favorites in saved order, removes duplicates, and caps the catalog at 20 models total. Stale or unauthorized favorites are skipped with a warning, anonymous providers remain supported, and mixed regular/Cloud Code catalogs preserve routing order and OAuth provider identity. Claude Desktop still controls which discovered model it initially activates.
- **Claude Desktop Favorites launches use the same catalog path everywhere** — interactive Favorites selection and Admin UI Favorites launches now choose an available favorite as the starting model while exposing the remaining compatible favorites through the same ordered catalog.

### Fixed

- **Headless `relay-ai claude` launches fail clearly instead of crashing** ([#29](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/29)) — when no provider/model is resolved and an interactive wizard would be required, non-TTY environments now receive an actionable error explaining how to pass `--provider` and `--model`.
- **Windows builds use a cross-platform UI asset copy step** ([#30](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/30)) — `npm run build` no longer depends on POSIX-only `mkdir -p` and `cp` commands. Docker builds also copy the required `scripts/` directory before running the build.
- **Claude Desktop is detected in the Windows `AnthropicClaude` install directory** ([#31](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/31)) — Squirrel installations under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude` can now be launched normally.
- **Concurrent transparent-proxy launches no longer delete a session that is still being created** ([#33](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/33)) — cleanup gives incomplete session directories a grace period and no longer deletes them after transient read errors.
- **Claude Desktop and Codex/ChatGPT app help works without a TTY** ([#35](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/35)) — `relay-ai claude-app --help` and `relay-ai codex-app --help` print help instead of falling through to the interactive-terminal guard.
- **Fresh Claude launches no longer inherit parent-session identity** ([#36](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/36)) — Relay strips Claude Code's parent/child session markers before spawning a new session, preventing it from being misidentified as nested and preserving normal top-level behavior such as transcript saving.
- **Claude Desktop cleanup no longer clobbers another live Relay session** ([#37](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/37)) — cleanup and `--restore` now respect session ownership. Racing launches preserve the original `_meta.json` backup, lock writes are atomic, and config files remain in place while the active metadata still references them.
- **Claude Desktop self-heals from a corrupt session lock instead of getting stuck** — a `.relay-ai.lock` that fails to parse (torn write, disk-full, manual edit) used to be treated as a permanently live session: every future `relay-ai claude-app` launch refused to start, auto-recovery never kicked in, and `--restore` refused to fix it. The lock is written atomically (temp file + rename), so a corrupt lock at the real path can never belong to a running session — it's now treated like a stale lock and cleared automatically.
- **Claude Desktop no longer duplicates every 1M-context Relay model** — `relay-ai claude-app` now exposes one context-accurate picker entry per model: sub-1M models remain normal entries, while models with at least one million tokens appear once with a `1M` label and retain their exact context limit.

### Maintenance

- Windows-specific test assertions now normalize paths and platform behavior so the same suite passes on Windows and POSIX systems ([#32](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/32)).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Server: colliding OpenAI model ids across providers are disambiguated** — when multiple exposed providers offer the same OpenAI-format model id (e.g. `grok-4.5` from xai/groq/openrouter, `kimi-k2.7-code` from moonshot-global/zen/go), `GET /openai/v1/models` emitted duplicate ids and the catalog could only ever route to the last-registered provider, silently shadowing the rest. Unique ids stay bare; colliding ones are scoped as `provider/model`. Also fixes the same collision-blindness in the Admin UI status table / CLI printout (both grouped models per provider before computing collisions, hiding cross-provider clashes), and adds a live search box to the Admin UI's exposed-models table.
- **Server: scoped model ids are rewritten before direct upstream forwarding** — the direct-passthrough branch (Zen/Go and any provider with its own `completionsUrl`, e.g. Moonshot) forwarded the client-supplied model field unchanged, so a collision-scoped alias (from the fix above) was sent verbatim to providers that only know the bare id, breaking every affected model on that path. Fixed to rewrite to the real upstream id first.
- **Server: OpenAI-format `finish_reason` now matches the real wire enum** — `/openai/v1/chat/completions` passed the Vercel AI SDK's internal `finishReason` straight through (hyphenated values like `tool-calls`/`content-filter`, plus non-OpenAI values `error`/`other`/`unknown`). A strict client validating this field (Cursor) could reject the response outright.
- **Server: reasoning-heavy turns no longer produce an empty OpenAI-format response** — the OpenAI-format path had no handling for the SDK's reasoning stream part/result field, unlike the Anthropic-format path. A model that spends its whole turn reasoning with little/no visible text (e.g. against Cursor's very long system prompt) produced zero forwarded content. Reasoning is now forwarded via `reasoning_content`.
- **Server: consolidated tool calls are no longer dropped on the OpenAI-format streaming path** — some providers (e.g. Alibaba/qwen) deliver a tool call as a single part instead of streamed input deltas. Without a matching case, zero `tool_calls` chunks were emitted for that turn — reasoning went out, then the stream ended with nothing usable, surfacing as Cursor's "Empty provider response" on every tool-calling turn against an affected model.
- **Server: OpenAI-format stream errors are surfaced instead of silently dropped** — the streaming handler had no case for the SDK's `error` stream part; an upstream failure mid-stream produced a bare, unexplained end-of-stream instead of any indication something went wrong. Errors are now logged and surfaced as visible content.
- **Server: assistant history messages with array-shaped content no longer lose their text** — some clients (Cursor) send assistant turns with `content` as an array of parts, not a plain string. The OpenAI-format request translator only read string content, silently discarding array-shaped text and leaving a message with empty content and no tool calls — which strict upstreams (Alibaba/qwen) reject outright as invalid. This was the root cause behind persistent "Empty provider response" / "Bad Request" failures in Cursor on any multi-turn conversation.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **UI: OpenCode Zen / Go can be added with an API key** — the Providers tab no longer falls through to a bogus “needs a base URL / import from OpenCode” error. Zen/Go use the same shared cloud-add path as the CLI (save key → seed Zen + Go → refresh catalogs).
- **UI: provider and model header counts update after add / delete / OAuth / refresh** — `initModels()` always re-renders the Providers stats strip so counts stay in sync.
- **UI: `RELAY_AI_SERVER_PASSWORD` prefills the Server password field** — Docker/Compose env password appears in the form (masked, with Reveal), and Start uses it without retyping.
- **UI: Server provider checklist refreshes after add / delete** — no full page reload needed to see new providers under Specific providers.

### Changed

- **Providers are Relay-native; OpenCode CLI is optional import only** — OAuth no longer offers “Via OpenCode” / auth broker; unsupported OAuth providers point at `providers add` or optional `providers import`. First-run “Set up your own AI provider” no longer silently imports from OpenCode. Bedrock/Azure/Vertex messaging no longer treats OpenCode as the required setup path.

### Documentation

- README and `docs/PROVIDERS.md` clarify Zen/Go as normal API providers and OpenCode CLI import as optional.
- `docs/DOCKER.md` notes that `RELAY_AI_SERVER_PASSWORD` prefills the Server form (masked + Reveal).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Docker Server + Admin UI** — official `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` run an always-on admin UI (`relay-ai ui --server`) and in-process API gateway. Default ports **8787** (UI) and **17645** (gateway). App launch stays on the host; the container UI hides Apps & Launch and Antigravity.
- **File-backed credentials for headless / Docker** — when the OS keyring is unavailable, API keys and device-code OAuth tokens persist to `RELAY_AI_HOME/secrets.json` (mode `0600`) on the Compose volume.
- **Zen/Go auto-seed** — with `OPENCODE_API_KEY` set and an empty providers volume, Relay seeds OpenCode Zen + Go and refreshes empty model caches at UI/server bootstrap.
- **Advertised LAN host + published ports** — network URL cards prefer `RELAY_AI_ADVERTISE_HOST(S)`, then the browser Host header, and use `RELAY_AI_GATEWAY_HOST_PORT` so remapped host ports appear correctly (not container-only `172.x` / internal `17645`).
- **`RELAY_AI_SERVER_PASSWORD`** — env password for network quick-start / Compose (alongside `--password` and saved password).
- **`relay-ai server --trace`** and **Ctrl+C confirm** before stopping the foreground server (aligned with UI behavior).
- **Clipboard fallback on plain HTTP** — Copy buttons work when the admin UI is opened via LAN `http://…` (Clipboard API blocked outside secure contexts).

### Fixed

- **Server tab inputs no longer steal focus every 5s** — status polling skips full panel re-render while a field inside the Server panel is focused.
- **Bogus `relay-ai server --setup` messaging** — banners and docs point to Configure & start / env password instead of a non-existent flag.

### Documentation

- New **[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md)** playbook for humans and AI assistants (questions to ask, exact Compose steps, ports, secrets, LAN advertise, troubleshooting).
- README and API server docs updated for container deployment.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Official Qwen Cloud provider support** — the provider catalog now includes separate **Qwen Cloud (Token Plan)** and **Qwen Cloud (Pay-As-You-Go)** entries with their official international endpoints, API-key authentication, independent credentials, live model discovery, and support across Relay targets including `relay-ai server`. Token Plan is intended for interactive coding and agent-tool workloads.
- **Official Qwen branding in `relay-ai ui`** — both Qwen Cloud entries use Qwen's standalone purple vector mark throughout the provider UI.

### Changed

- **Alibaba and Qwen billing regions are now unambiguous** — the existing `alibaba` provider remains compatible and is labeled **Alibaba DashScope (China)**, while Qwen Cloud Token Plan and PAYG remain separate because their keys and endpoints are not interchangeable. The built-in China label is migrated only when the saved provider still matches the original built-in configuration, preserving custom endpoints and credentials.
- **Token Plan no longer shows misleading PAYG prices** — Alibaba usage pricing is applied only to Qwen Cloud PAYG. Token Plan remains subscription/credit-based, while coding-agent pickers continue filtering image-only and non-tool-capable models.

### Documentation

- Updated the provider guide with the three Alibaba/Qwen choices, credential compatibility, endpoint differences, and guidance on which provider users should select.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Clearer device-code sign-in in `relay-ai ui`** — GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and xAI sign-in now shows the one-time code in a dedicated panel with a Copy button, an explicit **Open sign-in page** button, paste instructions, and live completion status. The browser is opened only after the user clicks the button.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot Free and paid plans now receive the correct model catalog** ([#25](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/25)) — sign-in records a non-secret Copilot plan summary, model refresh removes router, embedding, disabled, and non-chat entries, and Free accounts are restricted to the verified Free-compatible allowlist. If plan detection fails, relay-ai uses the same conservative Free policy instead of exposing models that may consume paid requests; stale cached catalogs are guarded at launch as well.
- **Provider logos are now consistent in the web UI** — provider model catalogs reuse the same brand-logo renderer as provider cards, including OAuth aliases such as xAI SuperGrok, instead of falling back to a different letter icon.
- **OAuth menus now show only supported subscription sign-ins** — the browser and interactive provider picker expose GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and xAI device-code flows without surfacing unsupported OAuth entries.

### Documentation

- Added `docs/SUBSCRIPTION-OAUTH.md` with web UI and terminal sign-in steps, Copilot Free and paid model behavior, safe fallback behavior when plan detection is unavailable, plan-change refresh guidance, and troubleshooting.
- Updated the README, provider guide, and Codex guide with the supported subscription providers, current OAuth command IDs, and the improved device-code flow.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Server: long model IDs no longer overflow the running-status model table in `relay-ai ui`** — each Anthropic / OpenAI ID cell now has its own Copy button (truncating with ellipsis and a hover tooltip for the full value), matching the existing URL-card copy affordance. The Server section column width was also widened so the four-column table is no longer cramped.
- **Server: "Free models only" now works without selecting any provider** — when Specific providers mode is selected but no provider is checked, the form previously blocked Start. It now allows Start when Free models only is enabled, in which case the gateway exposes all free/free-access models from every available provider. Dynamic hint text explains both branches (providers selected → only their free models; none selected → all free models across providers).

### Documentation

- Added a **Cursor** subsection to `docs/API_SERVER.md` covering how to point Cursor's "Override OpenAI Base URL" at the gateway using a Cloudflare quick tunnel. Cursor forbids private-network URLs (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, LAN IPs) for BYOK, so the guide walks through installing `cloudflared`, opening a `https://*.trycloudflare.com` tunnel to port 17645, configuring the Base URL with the required `/openai/v1` suffix, and troubleshooting the common Cursor-side failures (Agent-mode body shape, HTTP/1.1 toggle, model-name collisions with built-ins). Documents the known Cursor limitation that Override is global — built-in Cursor models and Relay custom models can't be used at the same time without toggling the OpenAI API Key / Override off and on.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Use Relay models alongside your normal Claude models in Claude Code** — the new transparent proxy mode keeps Claude Code signed in to Anthropic while adding a selected Relay model and compatible favorites to the same session. Enable it from the CLI wizard, pass `--http-proxy`, or select **Keep my Anthropic login and add Relay models** on the Claude Code card in `relay-ai ui`. Relay models are available through the `/model relay:<provider>:<model>` commands printed at launch because Claude Code cannot add them to its built-in model picker. Based on the transparent proxy contribution by Brandon Wallace ([@bman654](https://github.com/bman654)) in [#22](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/22), integrated and hardened in [#23](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/23).

### Security

- **Transparent proxy sessions are isolated and locked down** — every launch uses a password-protected loopback proxy and a unique temporary certificate authority that is removed when the session ends. Native Anthropic requests preserve their original authentication and body, while registry credentials are available only to the selected Relay model and compatible favorites. Non-local inherited proxy settings and unsupported proxy protocols are rejected instead of being silently chained.

### Documentation

- Added setup, switching, security, compatibility, and troubleshooting guidance for transparent proxy mode to `README.md` and `docs/AI-AGENTS.md`.
- Added focused contribution guidelines and a pull request template in [#24](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/pull/24), including expectations for large, security-sensitive, and generated-file changes.

### Known limitations

- Transparent proxy mode is for **Claude Code**, not Claude Desktop, and currently preserves only a direct Anthropic login. Google Vertex AI configuration is not preserved, corporate proxy chaining is not supported, and the launch/proxy/cleanup flow has not yet been verified on Windows.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Browse provider models in the web UI** — clicking a provider card on the Providers & Keys page in `relay-ai ui` now opens a dedicated model browser for that provider, with case-insensitive search across model IDs and names, pagination (25 models per page), and input/output pricing per million tokens when the provider publishes it. The sidebar brand also now links to the relay-ai GitHub repository.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **MCP tools and the built-in browser now work in Codex / ChatGPT desktop app with non-native models** (#21) — Codex wraps MCP server tools (and the built-in browser, which is itself exposed as an MCP tool) in a proprietary `{type:"namespace"}` envelope. relay-ai already flattened these into callable function tools for the model, but sent the model's tool call back to Codex as a flat name instead of splitting it back into the `{namespace, name}` shape Codex's own dispatcher requires, so every call was rejected with `unsupported call: ...`. Also added translation for `tool_search` (deferred/lazy-loaded tools), `additional_tools` turn-local tool definitions, and `type:"custom"` tools (e.g. `apply_patch`). Credit to [bharat2808/codex-ollama-proxy](https://github.com/bharat2808/codex-ollama-proxy) — a community proxy for Codex + Ollama that solved this same class of problem first and whose approach to flattening/splitting namespace tools informed this fix.
- **`Fatal error: remote compaction v2 expected exactly one compaction output item` no longer crashes Codex / ChatGPT app sessions** — Codex's "remote compaction v2" requires the response to contain exactly one output item of type `compaction`; relay-ai was replying with a normal reasoning+message turn, which Codex rejected outright. relay-ai now asks the model for a plain-text summary and returns it wrapped as the single `compaction` item Codex expects, decoding it back into readable context on later turns.
- **Compaction no longer fires prematurely in the ChatGPT desktop app** — a single large tool result (e.g. a browser snapshot) could push a session past relay-ai's auto-compact threshold within a couple of turns. Raised `model_auto_compact_token_limit` from 55% to 90% of the model's context window.

### Added

- **Untruncated Codex request/response trace dump** — `relay-ai codex`/`codex-app --trace` now writes full, unclipped `/v1/responses` request and response bodies (tools array, every input item) to `~/.relay-ai/logs/codex-body-dump.jsonl`, for diagnosing Codex tool-shape and compaction issues without reproducing twice.

### Documentation

- Updated the MCP known-limitation notes in `README.md`/`docs/CODEX.md` to reflect the fix above, corrected stale auto-compaction figures, and documented a new known limitation: `image_gen` (image generation) calls an OpenAI-only image backend relay-ai doesn't implement, and most registry models can't generate images regardless — no workaround planned.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Automatic update notifications in the CLI and web UI** — interactive CLI commands now perform a silent, cached check for newer npm releases and show the exact update command when one is available. The web UI displays the same information below its version badge with a copyable update command. Network failures never block startup or normal commands.
- **Embedded gateway lifecycle messages in `relay-ai ui`** — starting or stopping the Server Gateway from the browser now prints a concise terminal message showing whether it started in local or network mode and how many models are exposed.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Registry server errors now preserve the real upstream status and detail** — SDK-backed Anthropic and OpenAI routes no longer collapse provider errors into an opaque `502 Bad Gateway`, making authentication, rate-limit, and invalid-request failures actionable.
- **The web UI version now stays synchronized with the CLI** — the sidebar version is derived from `package.json` at server startup instead of using a hardcoded value.
- **README demo previews render reliably** — broken embedded video previews now use YouTube-hosted thumbnails.

### Documentation

- **Restored the complete project documentation set** — setup and reference guides for Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini, providers, the API server, model compatibility, troubleshooting, and AI agents are tracked in the repository again.
- **Package archives are excluded from source and npm packages** — generated `.tgz` files can no longer pollute the repository root or recursively include themselves in a release archive.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **GPT-5.6 Luna (OpenAI OAuth) now works** — `gpt-5.6-luna` was selectable but failed at inference (`404 Model not found` / "No output generated") because it requires OpenAI's Codex **Responses-Lite over WebSocket** transport (`wss://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`), while relay-ai only spoke the standard HTTP Responses path. relay-ai now opens an outbound WebSocket per request for models the backend flags this way, forwarding the ChatGPT subscription headers (`ChatGPT-Account-Id`, `originator`, `version`, `x-openai-internal-codex-responses-lite`) and the `OpenAI-Beta: responses_websockets` opt-in, and streams the event frames back as SSE. One socket per request, so concurrent Claude Code requests (e.g. background title generation) can't be crossed. Thanks to @tonyb760 for the detailed report (#18). (`store: false` and the `ChatGPT-Account-Id`/`originator` headers were already shipped in 0.4.0.)

### Added

- **Backend-driven transport selection for ChatGPT Codex models** — relay-ai reads the `use_responses_lite` / `prefer_websockets` capability flags the ChatGPT Codex model endpoint reports and routes each model accordingly, instead of hardcoding model names. Future Responses-Lite models are picked up automatically with no code change. The static seed carries the same flags as a fallback for a discovery-endpoint outage.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **`relay-ai ui` — Visual launcher web UI** — Run `relay-ai ui` to open a browser-based dashboard for managing providers and launching every supported coding agent from a single interface. Features include:
  - **App launcher cards** — one card per tool (Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Anti-gravity CLI, Antigravity App, Antigravity IDE, Claude Code Desktop, Codex Desktop). Click to expand, pick a provider and model, and launch.
  - **In-UI model selection** — selecting a provider and model before clicking Launch passes `--provider`/`--model` directly to the terminal command, bypassing the interactive picker entirely. The terminal opens straight to the running session with no second selection step.
  - **Real brand icons** — every app card shows its actual brand icon: Anthropic orange for Claude Code CLI and Desktop, OpenAI Codex dark for Codex CLI and Desktop, Google gradient for Gemini CLI, Anti-gravity dark for the AGY family, and the relay-ai SVG mark for the sidebar logo.
  - **General Favorites sidebar** — view and manage your saved favorite models with a slot indicator bar (Slots used X/20).
  - **Antigravity Favorites sidebar** — dedicated favorites panel for Antigravity sessions.
  - **Provider management panel** — add providers from templates, delete, and trigger model-list refreshes without leaving the UI.
  - **Recent launch folders** — picker remembers your last-used working directories for CLI launchers.

- **Server tab in `relay-ai ui`** — run the same API gateway as `relay-ai server`, configured and launched entirely from the browser instead of a terminal wizard:
  - **Setup form** mirrors the CLI wizard: favorites-only vs. specific providers (searchable multi-select), "Mask gateway model ids" for Claude Desktop / Cowork discovery, and local-only vs. network listen mode with a password field (reuse a saved password or save a new one to the OS keychain).
  - **Running view** shows live, copyable Anthropic and OpenAI endpoint URLs (plus one per network interface in network mode), a reveal/copy API key, and the full exposed model catalog (provider, name, Anthropic ID, OpenAI ID) — with a one-click Stop.
  - Runs in-process inside the `relay-ai ui` server (no child process), so it stops automatically when the UI is closed, and shares the same saved settings as the terminal wizard so both stay in sync.

- **Codex Desktop app (`relay-ai codex-app`) in the UI launcher** — the Codex Desktop app now appears as a launcher card in `relay-ai ui` with correct detection paths for macOS (`/Applications/Codex.app`, `~/Applications/Codex.app`) and Windows (`Programs/Codex`, `Programs/OpenAI Codex`, `openai-codex-electron`), the Codex brand icon, and a dark card background. Previously `relay-ai codex-app` was a full working CLI command but was invisible in the UI.

- **Claude Desktop (`relay-ai claude-app`) in the UI launcher** — Claude Desktop is now a launcher card in `relay-ai ui` alongside the CLI tools, with a launch-folder control suppressed (it's a GUI app). Favorites launch resolves the first matching favorite and passes it through so the terminal skips the picker.

- **`relay-ai server --quick` / `--saved` and one-run override flags** — after configuring the server once, start it without prompts via `relay-ai server --quick` (or `--saved`). Any one-run option also skips the wizard: `--listen local|network`, `--providers all|favorites|id1,id2`, `--free-only` / `--no-free-only`, `--mask-gateway-ids` / `--no-mask-gateway-ids`, and `--password <value>`. Non-interactive shells (scripts, services, CI, pipes) use quick mode automatically; if it resolves to network mode with no `--password` and no saved password, it now exits with a clear error instead of prompting.

- **`--trace` now covers Codex App WebSocket traffic, plus live generation progress** — the Codex App's WebSocket `/v1/responses` handler had no debug logging, so `--trace` was blind to nearly all Codex App traffic; it now logs incoming requests, context/compaction checks, and resolved effort just like the HTTP path. Generation also reports progress roughly every 3 seconds (running reasoning length and a tail preview), so a stuck or looping generation can be observed live instead of only after the fact.

- **`relay-ai antigravity` / `relay-ai antigravity-ide` / `relay-ai agy` — Antigravity launcher support** — one of the biggest additions in this release: launch Google's Antigravity CLI, desktop app, or IDE through relay-ai's provider registry, so you can use any configured provider's models — Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, and more — inside Antigravity instead of only Google's own models. Fully supported on both macOS and Windows, including app/IDE detection, launch, and quit on both platforms, plus a dedicated Antigravity Favorites list for quick model switching.

- **`relay-ai chatgpt`** — alias for `relay-ai codex-app`. OpenAI merged the Codex desktop app into the ChatGPT desktop app on 2026-07-09; the app is now named `ChatGPT.app` on macOS (bundle id and config format unchanged) and opens in Codex mode for existing Codex users. Detection/launch/quit logic and UI labels updated accordingly. The Windows install path was updated by analogy with the confirmed macOS rename and is not yet verified against a real install.

- **Nvidia (build.nvidia.com) provider support** — Nvidia's model catalog is now available as a provider template, wired up end-to-end alongside the other native providers.

- **Kilo Code provider support** — Kilo Code is now available as a provider template, including its free anonymous-access tier (no API key required to use its free models).

### Fixed

- **Codex Desktop / Claude Desktop restart on Windows silently did nothing if the app minimized to the tray instead of exiting** — the restart flow's `waitForQuit` considered the app "closed" as soon as its window handle disappeared, which happens immediately for tray-minimizing apps even though the process (and its old config) is still running. The next launch would then just refocus the stale process, so a newly selected model never took effect. `waitForQuit` now polls actual process existence instead of window visibility, so the existing force-kill fallback actually runs when needed.

- **Security: Codex Desktop's WebSocket transport now requires the same authentication as its HTTP path** — the `/v1/responses` WebSocket upgrade handler had no auth check, unlike the HTTP `POST` handler for the same route, so any local process could open a WebSocket connection to the proxy and get model completions on your configured credentials. It now enforces the identical bearer-token check.

- **Security: custom provider display names are now escaped in the UI** — a custom endpoint's display name was rendered into the Providers list without HTML-escaping, allowing a crafted name to run arbitrary script in the `relay-ai ui` page.

- **Security: `allowInsecureLocal` no longer permits plaintext HTTP to public hosts** — the custom-endpoint URL validator now also requires the resolved address to actually be a loopback or private/LAN address before allowing `http://`, closing a gap where a public IP could be registered with insecure HTTP.

- **Security: unsafe app-launch arguments are now rejected instead of shell-escaped** — the native terminal launcher's argument quoting didn't fully protect the outer shell command on every platform. Arguments outside the safe identifier character set are now rejected outright rather than escaped.

- **Codex App: non-rate-limit errors no longer show a fake "context too large" message** — an invalid API key, a bad request, or an upstream outage was rewritten into a canned "conversation context was too large to summarize" message, hiding the real cause. The actual error message is now shown.

- **OAuth-authenticated Anthropic-format providers no longer break permanently after token expiry, and now work correctly through `relay-ai server`** — the Anthropic-passthrough path used by `relay-ai claude`/`codex`/`gemini`/`server` now retries once with a refreshed token on a 401, and `relay-ai server`'s passthrough now applies the same request handling and forwards the same custom provider headers that `relay-ai claude` already did, instead of dropping them and corrupting streaming responses.

- **`relay-ai gemini`: selecting a non-default model from a backend-routed provider could silently route to the wrong model** — a backend-routing rewrite changed the model's internal id but Gemini CLI was still launched with the old one, so requests transparently fell back to a different model than the one selected.

- **Windows: Codex CLI could be reported as "not found" even when installed** — the binary-verification step didn't account for `.cmd`-wrapped installs the way the actual launch step already did, and newer Node.js versions could reject running the check directly.

- **`relay-ai gemini`: non-streaming tool calls no longer lose their arguments** — a local proxy mapped tool-call results using an incorrect field name, so a non-streaming request that ended in a tool call reached the client with no arguments at all.

- **`relay-ai ui` Server tab: rapid double-clicking Start could corrupt saved settings** — two near-simultaneous start requests could both pass the "already running" check and race through setup, with the losing request's settings silently overwriting the winner's. Start requests are now serialized.

- **Codex Desktop: the "keep session running" option on Ctrl+C is back** — an unrelated commit had accidentally dropped the confirmation prompt, so Ctrl+C always restored your Codex config immediately with no way to decline. The prompt is restored.

- **Gemini CLI: stale OAuth auth settings no longer block relay-ai launches** — if `~/.gemini/settings.json` had `security.auth.selectedType` set to `oauth-personal` from a previous direct Gemini CLI login, Gemini CLI preferred that saved setting over relay-ai's injected proxy API key and could fail before reaching the local proxy. `relay-ai gemini` now launches Gemini with an isolated temporary `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, forces `gemini-api-key` auth for the child process, and cleans up the temporary overlay when Gemini exits. Fixes [#13](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/13).

- **Codex App: WebSocket `/v1/responses` fully implemented** — the proxy now accepts WS upgrades, reads the request from the first text frame, runs the same `translateResponsesRequest` + `streamResponsesResponse` path as the HTTP POST handler, and streams each SSE event back as a WS text frame (raw JSON, no SSE envelope). Fixes the "Stream error / Reconnecting 5/5" loop seen in newer Codex App versions when the proxy rejected upgrades with HTTP 503. Connection closes cleanly when the stream ends.

- **Codex App: context trimming no longer over-trims by 3x** — the proxy's internal character limit now matches the caller's token-to-character estimate, preventing oversized sessions from being reduced to a single message before compaction.

- **Codex App: relay-model sessions compact earlier** — the app now sets `model_auto_compact_token_limit` to 55% of the selected model's context window, giving compaction more headroom across providers with different practical limits.

- **Codex App: compaction payloads are protected before upstream** — compaction-sized requests now get oversized text/tool-output blobs clipped and are trimmed to a conservative budget before they reach Anthropic, Gemini, xAI, OpenRouter, OpenCode, or other relay providers.

- **Codex App: empty translated input no longer creates invalid Anthropic requests** — empty input now becomes a non-empty placeholder message instead of `messages.0` with empty content.

- **UI → terminal model selection is now end-to-end** — selecting a provider and model in `relay-ai ui` and clicking Launch previously showed the full interactive provider/model picker in the terminal anyway. Two bugs combined to cause this: (1) `claude-app` and `codex-app` arg parsers used a bare `for...of` loop that dumped every arg — including `--provider` and `--model` — into `claudeArgs` without calling `tryConsumeRelayLaunchFlag`, so `parsed.launchProvider`/`parsed.launchModel` were always `undefined`; (2) neither command had a boot path that checked those values. Both are now fixed.

- **`claude-app` with Groq: requests with more than 128 tools no longer fail** — Groq's API enforces a hard limit of 128 tools per request. Claude Desktop sends its full tool set on every request — built-in file/bash tools plus every configured MCP tool and injected skill — which easily exceeds 128. The proxy now automatically truncates to 128 when routing via `@ai-sdk/groq`, logging `tools truncated: N → 128 (provider limit)` to the trace log when trimming fires.

- **Non-Anthropic providers: null optional parameters no longer cause tool-call validation errors** — Open models (GPT OSS 120B, GLM, Z.AI, and similar) sometimes emit `null` for optional tool-call parameters instead of omitting the key. Claude Desktop's schema validator treats `null` as a type mismatch and shows *"Tool call validation failed: parameters for tool X did not match schema"*. The proxy now strips top-level `null` values from all tool-call inputs before returning them to the client. Applies to both streaming and non-streaming response paths.

- **`--trace` logs now show provider API errors** — when a provider returned an error (429 rate limit, 400 bad request, 502 upstream failure, etc.), the proxy's catch block sent the error response but never logged it, so `--trace` output appeared clean even on repeated failures. All SDK-level errors in both the Anthropic-format and OpenAI-format proxy handlers are now logged with the provider npm, upstream model ID, and error message.

- **Claude Desktop: direct OpenAI (ChatGPT) OAuth launches keep OAuth routing metadata** — selecting an OpenAI OAuth model directly in `relay-ai claude-app`, instead of through Favorites, no longer drops `authType`, `oauthAccountId`, or model reasoning metadata while building the local gateway catalog. This keeps GPT-5.5 and other ChatGPT OAuth models routed through the ChatGPT Codex backend instead of the public OpenAI API. Reported by @lffzdd ([#15](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/15)).

- **New OpenAI models newer than GPT-5.5 (e.g. GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna) could fail outright when using a direct API key** — a hardcoded list of "which models require OpenAI's Responses API" only named GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.5 specifically, so any newer model silently fell back to the older Chat Completions endpoint, which OpenAI rejects for these models. Every OpenAI model now defaults to the Responses API (a strict superset of Chat Completions), so this no longer needs a code update for each new model release. Reported by @tonyb760 ([#17](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/17)).

- **Refreshing an OAuth-based provider's model list could silently hide newly released models with no indication anything was wrong** — if live model discovery failed for a ChatGPT- or SuperGrok-authenticated provider, the refresh silently overwrote your existing (possibly more current) cached model list with an older, built-in fallback list, and reported success regardless. Refreshing now keeps your existing cached list when live discovery fails, and clearly reports the failure and its cause instead of failing silently.

- **xAI OAuth-authenticated providers failed to refresh their model list** — the model-refresh command didn't recognize the `xai-oauth` provider template, so refreshing a Grok OAuth provider's model catalog threw an "unsupported template" error instead of updating it.

- **Anonymous/free-access providers (e.g. Kilo Code) failed with "No credential" in Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, and Claude Desktop** — the shared credential-resolution logic that already correctly handled these providers in `relay-ai claude`/`gemini`/`agy` had drifted out of sync in three other launch paths, which still required a real API key even for providers designed to work without one.

- **Non-streaming requests to OpenAI's ChatGPT/Codex OAuth backend failed with a confusing "Stream must be set to true" error** — that backend requires streaming for every request, but a non-streaming retry (e.g. after a transient upstream error) was still forwarded as-is. relay-ai now always streams internally for that backend and assembles a complete response itself, regardless of what the client requested.

- **xAI's `grok-4.5` wasn't recognized as a reasoning-effort model** — the hardcoded model-name check only matched `grok-4.3`, so newer Grok models silently lost the ability to control reasoning effort.

- **Reasoning effort was silently dropped for xAI models launched through Favorites/model-switching** — the effort-application code looked at the gateway's local alias id instead of the real upstream model id, so the setting never applied whenever a model was chosen via the switch-menu/favorites catalog rather than a direct launch.

- **xAI context window sizing used a stale, hardcoded model-name pattern instead of live data** — newer Grok models (e.g. `grok-4.5`, `grok-4.20`) weren't recognized by the old pattern match, causing incorrect context-window sizing and premature or mistimed compaction.

- **DeepSeek tool calls could leak as raw text instead of firing** — DeepSeek's "DSML" tool-call markup sometimes came through the Codex App path unparsed, showing up as garbled text in the response instead of executing the intended tool call.

- **Upstream streams that died silently could hang a request forever** — if an upstream provider connection stopped sending data without an error or a clean end, the request had no timeout and would hang indefinitely; stream errors also weren't being recorded to `--trace` output.

- **Windows Credential Manager silently failed to save long OAuth tokens** — Windows' underlying credential store has a roughly 1,280-character limit per entry, so longer tokens (e.g. some OpenAI OAuth JWTs) failed to save without any visible error.

- **GitHub Copilot model listing was broken** — the provider hit the wrong API endpoint and was missing a required header, so its model catalog couldn't be fetched even with a valid Copilot subscription.

### Known limitations

- **Very large pre-existing Codex App sessions may still fail relay-model compaction** — sessions that already grew under native GPT-5.5 can exceed a 1 M-token relay model's practical compaction budget when switched to Claude or another relay model. relay-ai now clips oversized text/tool-output blobs and trims as a last resort, but this is best-effort recovery, not a guarantee. The reliable recovery path is to continue or compact once with a native Codex/GPT model when quota is available, or start a fresh relay-model session.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Windows: Claude Desktop 3P config now writes to the correct path** — relay-ai was writing the `configLibrary` to `%APPDATA%\Claude-3p` (Roaming) but Claude Desktop reads from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p` (Local). The config is now written to the correct location. Reported by Trojan28A ([#11](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/11)).

- **Windows: Claude Desktop and Codex App now launch correctly from MSIX installs** — `Start-Process 'shell:AppsFolder\...'` failed silently due to PowerShell backslash double-escaping via `JSON.stringify`. The launcher now uses `cmd /c start` with an argument array, which bypasses PowerShell string parsing entirely and correctly opens MSIX-packaged apps. ([#11](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/11)).

- **Windows: OpenCode CLI now discovered correctly when `where.exe` returns multiple results** — `where.exe opencode` returns both a bare script and a `.cmd` wrapper. relay-ai was taking the first result (the bare script), which Node's `spawn()` cannot execute directly. relay-ai now prefers the `.cmd` entry. The same fix applies to the `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` binary lookups. The OpenCode `serve` subprocess also now uses `cmd.exe /c` on Windows to avoid Node 22's DEP0190 deprecation warning. ([#11](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/11)).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Go models no longer mislabeled as Anthropic format** — OpenCode Go models (e.g. `minimax-m3`, `qwen3.7-plus`, `minimax-m2.7`, `qwen3.7-max`, `qwen3.6-plus`) were incorrectly classified as `modelFormat: 'anthropic'` due to stale `@ai-sdk/anthropic` npm entries written by the OpenCode cache. The Go backend is an OpenAI-compatible gateway only; relay-ai now clamps any `anthropic` format classification to `openai` for all Go models regardless of cache data. Reported by Philip2050 ([#10](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/10)).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Codex App: old sessions no longer show "Custom" as the model name** — relay-ai previously wrote its internal alias model ID (e.g. `go__glm-5.2`) into `config.toml`, which Codex baked into every session record. Reopening that conversation in native Codex showed "Custom" because the alias is unrecognized. relay-ai now writes `gpt-5.5` as the display model so sessions record a name Codex recognizes, enabling clean resume without errors.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Codex App: rate limit errors now appear in the conversation instead of crashing silently** — when a model hits its usage limit (e.g. OpenCode Go's 5-hour cap), the proxy now injects a readable error message directly into the Codex App conversation: `"5-hour usage limit reached. Resets in Xmin. To continue using this model now, enable usage from your available balance: ..."`. Previously the session just stalled with no explanation in the UI.

- **Codex App: rate limit errors print a clean one-liner in the terminal** — instead of flooding the terminal with full RetryError stack traces (one per retry attempt, per request), the proxy now prints a single `[relay-ai] <model>: <message>` line per failed request.

- **Codex proxy: removed SDK default `console.error` on stream failures** — the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` calls `console.error(error)` by default whenever the stream encounters an error. This was the root cause of the full stack trace dumps. The proxy now passes `onError: () => {}` to suppress this. The error is still handled through the stream pipeline and surfaced to the user.

- **Codex App: context overflow no longer crashes long sessions** — relay-ai now writes `model_context_window` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit` into `~/.codex/config.toml` at session start. Codex uses these values to trigger auto-compaction before the conversation reaches the model's hard limit, preventing the compaction-fails-at-limit crash that previously broke sessions and made them unrecoverable. Applies to single-provider, favorites, and Vertex AI sessions alike.

- **Codex App: proxy-level message truncation as a safety net** — if a conversation history arrives that already exceeds 85% of the selected model's context window (e.g. a long native GPT-5.5 session loaded into a 1 M-token model), relay-ai silently drops the oldest messages before forwarding to the upstream model. The session continues in a degraded but functional state instead of crashing with an unrecoverable error.

- **Codex App: Ctrl+C now shows a confirmation menu instead of immediately closing** — pressing Ctrl+C now presents an arrow-key selection menu: *"Close Codex Desktop and restore your Codex config?"* (Yes / No). Pressing Ctrl+C a second time during the prompt, or pressing Enter on Yes, closes the app and restores config. Choosing No keeps the session running. SIGTERM and SIGHUP still close immediately without a prompt.

- **Codex App: `--trace` request observability** — `--trace` mode now logs `previous_response_id`, `input_items`, and `body_bytes` for every incoming proxy request, making it possible to verify Codex's conversation-history protocol against a specific provider setup.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Codex App: background GPT model requests no longer crash your session** — The Codex desktop app has an internal agent subsystem that sends background requests using hardcoded model IDs (`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`), even when you've configured a completely different model like GLM or DeepSeek. These requests were hitting the relay-ai proxy and getting 404 errors, which interrupted your chat session and showed up as confusing error states in the UI. The proxy now silently routes those background requests to your configured starting model instead. Your session keeps running. (Fixes [#8](https://github.com/jacob-bd/relay-ai/issues/8))

- **Codex App: `GET /v1/responses` polling no longer returns 404** — Codex polls this endpoint in the background for session state. The proxy only handled `POST /v1/responses` before, so every poll got a 404. Now it returns an empty list, which is all Codex actually needs.

- **`--trace` output was a false negative** — `relay-ai codex-app --trace` would print `(no errors found in debug log)` even when the proxy had been silently dropping dozens of model-not-found failures the whole session. Trace output now surfaces `resolveModel failed` and `resolveModel fallback` lines so you can actually see what's happening.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-21

*Happy Father's Day!* 👨‍👦


### Added
- **New Native Providers** — Added native provider templates and registry support for DeepSeek (`deepseek`), Zhipu (`zhipu`), and Moonshot (`moonshot`), facilitating direct integration of Chinese LLM providers.
- **Experimental Gemini Support** — Introduced experimental support for Google Gemini models via a custom SDK adapter and local proxy, enabling `relay-ai gemini`.
- **Kimi/Moonshot Reasoning Level Selection** — Enabled support for Codex's native "Select Reasoning Level" UI for Kimi models by exposing `supported_reasoning_levels` in the proxy catalog and translating reasoning effort parameters.
- **Provider Documentation** — Created a dedicated [PROVIDERS.md](file:///Users/jbendavi/dev_projects/relay-ai/docs/PROVIDERS.md) documentation file explaining the differences between Kimi, Kimi Global, and Moonshot models, and linked it from the main README.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **xAI OAuth provider (`xai-oauth`)** — SuperGrok OAuth now gets its own registry slot and coexists with an API-key xAI provider; both can be active simultaneously without overwriting each other.
- **OpenAI OAuth provider (`openai-oauth`)** — ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth now gets its own registry slot and coexists with an API-key OpenAI provider; both can be active simultaneously without overwriting each other.
- **Browser auto-open during OAuth sign-in** — the device-code URL opens automatically in the default browser on all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux desktop) so you don't have to copy-paste the link.
- **3-tier model refresh for OpenAI OAuth** — on `providers refresh-models`, relay-ai first queries the ChatGPT Codex-specific endpoint for models guaranteed to work, falls back to the filtered general ChatGPT list, and uses a static seed only when both network tiers are unreachable.
- **Static xAI OAuth seed** — `buildXaiOAuthModels()` provides a fallback Grok model list (Grok 3 and 4 families) when the live `api.x.ai/v1/models` endpoint rejects the SuperGrok JWT.
- **Registry migration** — existing `{id: 'openai', authType: 'oauth'}` and `{id: 'xai', authType: 'oauth'}` entries are automatically renamed to `openai-oauth` and `xai-oauth` respectively on next load, preserving credentials and the original keyring slot.
- **Richer SDK error logging in proxy** — SDK errors now include the full response body alongside the message, making Codex inference failures easier to diagnose.
- **Fuzzy multi-token model search** — model search now supports multi-token AND matching and punctuation normalization. Queries like `"QWEN 3.7"` or `"qwen 2.5 32"` now successfully match models like `qwen3-7b` and `qwen2.5-coder-32b`.
- **Multi-model selection in favorites manager** — allow users to select and add multiple favorite models from a single provider in one step using `p.multiselect` with a dimmed visual cue `(Space to select, Enter to confirm)`.
- **Back-button navigation in launcher model selectors** — added `← Go back` options and handled cancellations to loop back to the provider selection menu (with the chosen provider pre-selected) in `relay-ai claude`, `relay-ai codex`, `relay-ai codex-app`, and the favorites addition wizard.
- **Alphabetical sorting of providers and models** — sorted the launcher and wizard selection lists alphabetically using natural collation for cleaner readability and easier scanning.
- **Server model catalog printout** — `relay-ai server` and `relay-ai server --vertex` now print a structured, grouped, and copy-pasteable catalog of model names along with their exact ID strings to copy-paste for `anthropic` and `openai` formats, respecting gateway masking.
- **Unified OpenAI Endpoint Support** — `relay-ai server` now supports a native OpenAI completions endpoint (`/openai/v1/chat/completions`) for all model types (Anthropic, Google Gemini, Grok, etc.) using a bidirectional translation adapter, allowing OpenAI-compatible clients to connect to any model.
- **API Server Guide & THE AI Counsel setup documentation** — added a comprehensive setup guide (`docs/API_SERVER.md`) explaining server startup outputs, network IPs, and detailed integration steps for connecting THE AI Counsel to the server gateway.


### Fixed
- **OpenAI OAuth model retrieval** — restored live model discovery for ChatGPT accounts by explicitly sending the installed `claude` version (`?client_version=`) and a standard `User-Agent`, which the Codex backend now strictly requires.
- **OpenAI OAuth "Instructions are required" error** — the ChatGPT Codex backend requires the system prompt in `openai.instructions` inside `providerOptions`, not the standard `system` field; this caused every Claude Code tool-use step to fail when using an OpenAI OAuth provider.
- **OpenAI OAuth token expiry** — `oauthCredentialShouldRefresh` now applies the pre-emptive 2-minute JWT expiry buffer to `openai` and `openai-oauth` providers, matching the existing behaviour for xAI and GitHub Copilot. Previously, OpenAI OAuth access tokens (1-hour TTL) were only checked against the hard `expires` wall-clock, not the JWT claim.
- **Broken provider state after `relay-ai providers auth openai-oauth`** — if a user passed the registry ID instead of the canonical `openai` to the auth command, `upsertOAuthProvider` would store `templateId: 'openai-oauth'` and all subsequent model refreshes would throw "unsupported template". Fixed by stripping the `-oauth` suffix when deriving `templateId`; the `else` branch also now updates `templateId` on existing entries, healing any already-broken providers on next auth.
- **xAI live model metadata gaps** — newly-discovered Grok models not yet in the static seed were built without `contextWindow`, `reasoning`, and using the raw ID prefix for `brand` instead of `deriveBrand`. This showed as 0 context window in Claude Code's status bar and incorrect brand metadata.
- **Speculative OpenAI model IDs removed from seed** — `gpt-5-pro`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-pro`, and `gpt-5.2-codex` were in the static seed but are not confirmed available on the ChatGPT Codex backend. They would surface in the model picker when the network was unreachable (Tier 3 path) and then fail at inference time.
- **Codex direct-tier routing** — `resolveCodexRoute` now keys on `model.npm === '@ai-sdk/openai'` instead of `provider.id === 'openai'`, correctly routing standard OpenAI models to the direct tier regardless of which provider ID variant is in use.
- **Proxy token loopback security** — hardened local proxy endpoints (`startProxyCatalog` and `codex-proxy`) against malicious cross-origin access by generating a unique `proxyToken` per session and enforcing `Origin`/`Referer` checks (`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`) as a defense-in-depth measure. (Thanks to @wnstfy)
- **Server password storage** — replaced plaintext file storage for LAN network passwords with system keyring storage (`@napi-rs/keyring`), hardened dotfolder permissions, and suppressed console output in `relay-ai server` mode. (Thanks to @wnstfy)
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** — replaced the deprecated `smol-toml` package, enforced a `ws` version override to resolve upstream security advisories, and aligned the root package-lock.json version. (Thanks to @wnstfy)
- **PowerShell launch corruption** — fixed command-line argument escaping logic in `relay-ai codex-app` and `claude-app` on Windows to use single-quoted string literals, preventing `\` path corruption. (Thanks to @sewersydah)
- **Codex-App favorites proxy routing and model validation** — resolved model ID mapping collisions by routing favorites through provider-prefixed slugs (e.g. `xai__grok-build-0.1`), resolving `Custom` model loading and Claude Haiku gateway routing errors in the favorites proxy. Skipped unsupported OAuth favorites and added diagnostics logs.
